# EDA506

In this week's exercise, we ran through an informal “checklist” of things to do when embarking on an exploratory data analysis. The checklist is as follows:

1.Formulate your question

2.Read in your data

3.Check the packaging

4.Run str()

5.Look at the top and the bottom of your data

6.Check your “n”s

7.Validate with at least one external data source

8.Try the easy solution first

9.Challenge your solution

10.Follow up
