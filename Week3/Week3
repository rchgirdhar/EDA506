#Formulate your question - Which state has the highest level of ozone levels per parts per million?

#Read in your data
ozone = `US.EPA.data.2017.(2)`

#remove spaces from column names
names(ozone) <- make.names(names(ozone),unique = TRUE)

#Check the packaging
nrow(ozone)
ncol(ozone)

#Run str()
#helps to identify potential problems with the data before plunging in head first into a complicated data analysis
str(ozone)


#Look at the top and the bottom of your data
#This helps to check if the data were read in properly and things are properly formatted.
head(ozone[, c(6:7, 10)])
tail(ozone[, c(6:7, 10)])

#Check your “n”s - helps to confirm that the number of observations is as expected.

#Let us look at the state names

#We got 54 results, but there are only 50 states

#Try the easy solution first
sol = group_by(ozone, State.Name) %>%

  as.data.frame %>%
  arrange(desc(ozone))

head(sol,1)
tail(sol,1)
#The results show that Rhode Island has the highest ozone level and South Dakota has the lowest ozone levels per parts per million.

#Challenge your solution - Can we find out the top 3 states with the highest ozone level?
head(sol,3)
tail(sol,3)
#The results show that Rhode Island has the highest ozone levels per parts per million, followed by Mississippi and Iowa.
